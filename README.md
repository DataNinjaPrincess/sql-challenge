Employee Database: A Mystery in Two Parts

Mr. Miller,

This repository contains the query views that you requested, however I am somewhat concerned about the data.  Employees are shown as working for multiple
departments at the same time, no one appears to been hired in the last 20 years, and unless there is an odd geographic isolation that I am unaware of 
it seems suspect that on average 183 employees share each surname.
