Employee Database: A Mystery in Two Parts

Mr. Miller,

This repository contains the query views that you requested.  Please note that two of the tables have foreign key associations in lieu of primary keys, as they 
did not have any columns with unique values.

I am concerned about the integrety of the data I was given.  Employees are shown as working for multiple departments at the same time, nearly a third of the 
workforce making between $40,000 and $40,750 annuall, and unless there is an odd geographic isolation that I am unaware of it seems suspect that on average 183 
employees share each surname.

Please let me know if you would like me to do additional research into this matter.

Respectfully,
Gina Freed
