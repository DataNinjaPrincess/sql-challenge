Employee Database: A Mystery in Two Parts

Mr. Miller,

This repository contains the query views that you requested.  Please note that two of the tables do not have primary keys but do have foreign key associations.


I am concerned about the data I was given.  Employees are shown as working for multiple departments at the same time, no one appears to been hired in the last 20 
years, and unless there is an odd geographic isolation that I am unaware of it seems suspect that on average 183 employees share each surname.
